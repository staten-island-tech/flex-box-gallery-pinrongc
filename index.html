                    saleswoman Peg (Dianne Wiest) discovers Edward and takes him home, where he falls for Peg's teen
                    daughter (Winona Ryder). However, despite his kindness and artistic talent, Edward's hands make

                <p>James Cameron's "Titanic" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage
                    of the R.M.S.
                    Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever
                    built.
                    She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the "ship of dreams" -- which ultimately carried over
                    1,500
                    people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15,
                    1912.</p>

            <p>On the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear primitive but are highly evolved.
                Because the
                planet's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human minds to
                allow
                for free movement on Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed former Marine, becomes mobile
                again
                through one such Avatar and falls in love with a Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). As a bond with her grows, he
                is
                drawn into a battle for the survival of her world.</p>
